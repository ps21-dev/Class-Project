Class Project - Photography Website by Pohla Saromo

This website is developed for educational project. 
I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and some JavaScript.

- Bootstrap is used to have responsive pages.
- Javascript is used for some interactive tricks to engage a user, such as: asking for their name when they enter the site, random quotes generator and random images on every refresh using array tricks, a window pop-up when the user clicks the Click Here button in the homepage. 

/* JS features details */

index.html

i. When the user gets to the homepage they will be asked to enter their
name and their name will be displayed in the welcome page and their input is saved to the localStorage.

ii. When the user clicks the “Click Here” button, the button will open a new window using the open() method.

iii. Random quotes are generated with the use of arrays.

gallery.html

i. Random images are displayed on each load with the use of arrays.

All webpages has a Last Modified dates located in footer with the use of Date and lastModified() method. 

All pages passed the validations with the use of HTML5 doctype, proper meta information,
character encoding information and proper use of the tags.

Next upgrade is to have a functional Contact page and viewable photos to showcase our Portfolio using PHP. (When I get the chance because I am really busy at school!!)

I made a photography website because my friends and I gets "hired" as photographers for events of friends of friends. So far, we have worked with 2 pre-nup shots and 2 weddings. So we thought we could do this as a sideline whenever we have a freetime for fun! I am hoping to enchance this website as I develop my skills and learn more tricks in the future.
